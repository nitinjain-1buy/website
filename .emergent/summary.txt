- ****: This component has also grown very large. The data fetching logic for the various admin tabs could be extracted into custom hooks to simplify the main component.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:** The  page is still a placeholder. Static pages like  that were not part of this job still use hardcoded content.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (The agent triggered a test run for the map locations feature but did not wait for the result. However, subsequent manual testing via screenshots was extensive and covered all new features.)
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin Dashboard URL:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent invoked the  but did not wait for or review its output, instead proceeding with other tasks. While the agent's manual screenshot-based testing was thorough and confirmed functionality, this is a procedural miss.</analysis>
