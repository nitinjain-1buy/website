<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request to fix broken news links evolved into a comprehensive feature build-out for a Market Intelligence platform. Key requirements implemented include: news aggregation, web scraping, a rule-based risk engine, a UI for the risk engine, and mobile UI fixes. The scope expanded to include a highly configurable admin panel for managing homepage content, risk engine rules, and data integrity. Most recently, the user requested a new Careers page and then asked for all static content across the website (e.g., Why Join Us, Team, How It Works) to be made configurable via the admin panel. The user has reported critical issues with the application not loading data on the preview URL.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI platform. A Market Intelligence feature provides news with risk analysis. A Careers page allows users to apply for jobs. A comprehensive admin panel at  (password: ) has been built to manage nearly all content on the site, including homepage stats, career roles/benefits, team members, use cases, and more. All this content is now stored in MongoDB and served via APIs. However, a critical issue prevents the frontend from communicating with the backend when viewed from the external preview URL, rendering the application unusable for the user.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was trying to resolve a critical bug where the Market Intelligence page (and likely the entire app) fails to load data when accessed from the external preview URL. The agent correctly identified that the frontend was trying to call , which is inaccessible from the user's device.
    - Status: BLOCKED
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Manual verification by the user on the preview URL is required after the fix. Standard testing tools within the environment cannot replicate this external access issue.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1: Critical - Frontend API calls fail on external preview URL (P0)**
  - **Issue 2: Market Intelligence Page Performance (P1)**

  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1: Critical - Frontend API calls fail on external preview URL (P0)**
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent tried changing  to an empty string and then attempted to set up a proxy with  and . Both approaches failed, likely because  requires proxy configuration within , not a separate file.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. Delete the incorrect .
        2. Modify  to add a  configuration to forward  requests to .
        3. Set  to an empty string () in .
        4. Restart the  service.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical blocker. The user cannot view or test any of the implemented features until the application is accessible on the preview link.
     - **Status**: BLOCKED
     - **Is recurring issue?** Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (user verification on preview is mandatory).
     - **Blocked on other issue:** None

  - **Issue 2: Market Intelligence Page Performance (P1)**
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent reduced the initial article load to 500 and removed the  property from the filter bar to fix scrolling.
     - **Next debug checklist:** The current fix is a temporary patch. Proper server-side pagination should be implemented. This involves updating the  endpoint to support  and  parameters and implementing infinite scroll or a Load More button on the frontend.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide a smooth and responsive user experience on the application's core feature page.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
     - **Blocked on other issue:** Blocked by **Issue 1**, as performance cannot be verified by the user.

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1: Complete Full Article Scraping (P2)**
     - **Where to resume:** The scraping process is about 51% complete. The agent needs to continue monitoring  and triggering new batches () until the pending count is near zero.
     - **What will be achieved with this?** The database will have complete data (full text or metadata) for all articles, improving the quality of the risk analysis.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (via API stats).
     - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **Connect Risk Engine to DB Configuration (P1):** Modify  to fetch its rules from the  collection in the database, making the admin panel changes effective.
    - **Refactor  (P2):** The  file has become excessively large (4500+ lines). The manager components (, , ) should be extracted into separate files under .
    - **User Verification (P3):** After the preview URL is fixed, guide the user to verify all recent features, especially the comprehensive admin panel.

    **Future Tasks:**
    - **ML/LLM Risk Engine (P3):** Upgrade the rule-based  to an ML/LLM-based system.
    - **BOM Risk Score Calculation (P3):** A long-term goal to build risk scores for Bill of Materials.
    - **Supplier Product Catalog Upload (P3):** A previously mentioned feature request for suppliers.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Careers Page Fully Implemented:** Created the UI, form, navigation, and backend endpoints.
- **Homepage Stats Fixed & Made Dynamic:** Updated stats content and fixed the layout to display 5 items.
- **Market Intelligence Page UI/UX Improved:** Addressed slow loading by reducing initial fetch size and fixed the broken scroll layout.
- **Risk Data Display Fixed:** Diagnosed and fixed an issue where risk scores were not appearing by running the risk analysis on newly fetched articles.
- **Massive Admin Panel Expansion:** Made almost all site content (Careers benefits/roles, Homepage problems/workflow, Team members, Use Cases, etc.) configurable via a new Page Content section in the admin panel.
- **Backend PUT Endpoints Standardized:** Corrected several backend endpoints to handle updates from the admin panel correctly.
- **Homepage Hero Text Fixed:** Resolved an issue where hardcoded frontend data was overriding dynamic data from the backend.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Database-Driven Frontend:** The architecture has shifted significantly to make nearly all frontend content dynamic and configurable from a backend database via an admin panel.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The current blocker highlights the critical difference between local development () and external preview environments, and the need for a robust solution like dev server proxying.
- **Large-Scale Admin UI:** The  now serves as a central hub for content management, demonstrating patterns for creating reusable forms and tables for various data models.

**key DB schema**

- **New in this session:** , , , , , , , .

**All files of reference**
- : **Key file to fix the blocker.** Needs proxy configuration.
- : **Key file to fix the blocker.**  needs to be set to .
- : The oversized component that needs refactoring.
- : Needs to be updated for the Connect Risk Engine to DB task.
- : Page with performance issues that needs server-side pagination.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-  is over 4500 lines. The manager components within it must be extracted into their own files under  to maintain sanity.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your absolute first priority is to fix the preview URL bug.** The user cannot see or test anything until this is resolved.
- **The Solution:** The previous agent's attempts were incorrect. The correct approach is to configure a proxy in , set  to , and remove the faulty  file. This allows relative API paths to work in both local and preview environments.
- After fixing the blocker and getting user verification, your next priorities should be addressing the Market Intelligence page performance with pagination and then connecting the live risk engine to the database configuration.
